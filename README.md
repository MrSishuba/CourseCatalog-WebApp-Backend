# Course Management Web Application  

This project is a foundational demonstration of integrating **ASP.NET Core Web API** with **Angular** for a CRUD-based school course management system. Designed to showcase clean coding practices and seamless front-end and back-end communication, the application allows users to manage a list of school courses efficiently.  

## Features  
### 1. **Course Listing**  
   - View a list of available school courses.  
   - Courses are displayed in a responsive grid system using Bootstrap cards.  

### 2. **CRUD Operations**  
   - **Create**: Add new courses, including details such as the module name and module code.  
   - **Read**: View detailed information about each course.  
   - **Update**: Edit existing course details, including module codes and names.  
   - **Delete**: Remove courses from the listing.  

### 3. **Seamless API Integration**  
   - The application demonstrates the connectivity between the Angular front-end and ASP.NET Core Web API.  
   - CRUD operations are performed dynamically, with the API facilitating communication with the database.  

## Key Technical Concepts  
- **ASP.NET Core Web API**  
   - Implementation of RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.  
   - Use of repository and interface patterns for structured and maintainable back-end code.  

- **Angular Front-End**  
   - Bootstrap-based responsive design for a clean UI.  
   - Integration of HTTP services for API calls.  

- **Database Communication**  
   - Backend interacts with the database to perform operations on course data.  

## Purpose  
This project served as an introduction to:  
- Transitioning from **MVC** to a modern **API-first architecture**.  
- Understanding client-server communication and data exchange using RESTful APIs.  
- Writing organized and maintainable code through the use of coding best practices like the **repository pattern**.  

## Technical Stack  
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API  
- **Frontend**: Angular, Bootstrap  
- **Database**: SQL Server  
- **Language**: C#, TypeScript
